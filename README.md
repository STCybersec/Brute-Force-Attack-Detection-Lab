# Brute-Force Detection Lab (Splunk)


This repo contains a Splunk-focused lab for detecting SSH brute-force attacks using synthetic and sample logs. It is intended as a portfolio piece for SOC analysts and blue-team practitioners.


## Contents
- `Auth_log_labeled.csv` — labeled dataset used in the lab
- `Queries/` — copy-paste-ready SPL queries for Splunk
- `Dashboards/bruteforce_dashboard.json` — exported dashboard JSON (importable)
- `Docs/IR_playbook_bruteforce.md` — incident response playbook
- `Screenshots/` — dashboard screenshots (add your images here)


## Quickstart (Splunk UI)
1. Upload `Auth_log_labeled.csv` in Splunk Web: Settings → Add Data → Upload
2. Index as `main` (or update queries to use your index)
3. Create saved searches by pasting the SPL files from `Queries/` into Search & Reporting and Save As → Report
4. Create alerts from saved searches (Save As → Alert) as needed
5. Create or import the dashboard JSON in Dashboards → Create New → Edit → Source
